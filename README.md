# Kenney's interface sound pack

**Kenney's interface sound pack, pre-packaged for use in Godot.**

This package includes 100 interface sounds like button clicks, snaps, minimize,
maximize, confirmation sounds and more.

Sounds were converted from Ogg Vorbis to WAV for lower CPU usage and better
compatibility with Godot, at the cost of slightly larger file size. This is a
lossless conversion which keeps the original sound quality.

See [this page](https://kenney.nl/assets/interface-sounds) for the original package.

*Support the original artist to create more free game assets:*
